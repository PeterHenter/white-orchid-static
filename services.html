                <p class="flow-text">
                    Our Oven Cleaning Edinburgh service consists of warming up the oven, which makes the grease soften
                    up and thereby easier to remove. We then use a special chemical that will leave your oven or grill
                    looking new, or certainly a whole lot cleaner than it was.

                    behind furniture. We wash the door and window frames, clean the oven and the windows, all to make
                    sure
                    the place is shining and fresh.
